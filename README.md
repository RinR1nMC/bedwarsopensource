## Installation
0. Install Java 11 as required
1. Download setup files in [Releases](relasestab) Tab or do this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/RinR1nMC/bedwarsopensource.git
```
2. Extract the zip files, put it in your server directory
3. Create a start file, so you don't have to type the command everytime. Depends on your OS and your Specs, here is what I recommended:
> For Windows: Create a batch file, put the below command inside

> For Mac OS and Linux: Create a .sh file, put the below command inside
```
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xms2G -Xmx2G -jar paper.jar
```
NOTE: -Xms2G is the minimum amount of ram, -Xmx2G is the maximum amount of ram. Depends on your server specs, you want to change it to fit perfectly.

4. Configure the setup (If you need)  
* Open server.properties, config server port and ip, and MOTD. If you are cracked user, change online-mode to off
* Replace the old server.png file with your server icon (128x128) and rename it to server.png
* Open \plugins\TAB\config.yml, change the header-footer and scoreboard
5. Start the server and enjoy!

## Conclusion
Now you have your own version of a Bedwars server. You can now play with your friend, do whatever you want!
